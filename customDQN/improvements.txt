Adaptive Learning Rate
Unbiased Memory
Dynamic replay memory training
Discrete decision systems
Seperate model for prev action and reward(?) (to better fit exploration)
Use inputs from back and front models to check collision, if no collision for action given by prev action and reward model, go ahead
use SVM to understand collision or not(?)
